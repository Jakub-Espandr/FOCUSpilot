tkinter
# Python requirements for ino2cpp.py Arduino to C++ converter
# 
# This file lists the Python dependencies required to run the
# Arduino INO to CPP/H conversion script.

# Standard library modules (included with Python, no installation needed):
# - os
# - re
# - shutil

# System packages that may need to be installed:
# - tkinter (Python GUI library - may need separate installation on some systems)

# Installation commands by system:
# Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install python3-tk
# Fedora/RHEL: sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
# Arch Linux: sudo pacman -S tk
# macOS: Usually included with Python installation
# Windows: Usually included with Python installation

# The script requires Python 3.x and the following modules:
# - os: for file and directory operations
# - re: for regular expressions (function extraction)
# - shutil: for file copying operations
# - tkinter: for the graphical user interface

# Optional but recommended:
# - Python 3.6+ for better string handling and f-strings

# To test if tkinter is available, run:
# python -c "import tkinter; print('tkinter is available')"

# If you get "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tkinter'", 
# install the tkinter package for your system using the commands above.
